        <p> When a Git-versioned model project is being viewed in the Trace Matrix, it can be compared to other versions of the same project in Git in multiple ways offered in the context menu.</p>
        <h2>Compare logical traces to Git Branch, Tag, or Reference</h2>
        <p>Right-click on the "models" project in the Package Exporer. The project can be compared to another using a Git tag or branch (grouped in <i>Remote Tracking</i> in Git's native dialog)</p>
        <h2>Compare logical traces to Git Commit...</h2>
        <p>Right-click on the "models" project in the Package Exporer. This command lets you compare the project to a selected Git commit. <i>Note:</i> You may want to
            choose whether all commits or only those of the checked-out branch are displayed in the
            dialog. This among many other options for this dialog can be set in Eclipse's
            preferences, <b>Team</b> -&gt; <b>Git</b> -&gt; <b>History</b>
        </p>
        <h2>Compare logical models...</h2>
        <p>This command lets you compare multiple projects selected in the Project Explorer pane. It allows for traces contained in an abritray number or kind of projects to be compared, and is not recommended for non-expert users.
