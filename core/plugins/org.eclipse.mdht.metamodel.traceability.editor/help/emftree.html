    </head>
    <body>
        <p> The EMF Tree provides a EMF-native view onto the traceability model. <i>All</i>
            information in the traceability tables originate from the traceability model and the
            domain elements it links to.</p>
        <h1>Tree item types</h1>
        <p>Most of the items in the EMF Tree are <i>Trace</i> instances which map source elements to
            target elements, e.g. a requirement to a data component. However also items for error
            message can be contained in the EMF Tree. Error message are graded into <i>hints</i>,
                <i>warnings</i> and <i>errors</i>, associated with an appropriate icon. Also, there
            are <i>Category</i> nodes for structuring traces.</p>
        <h1>Tree structure</h1>
        <p> There are category items to group requirement, SCS and vocabulary traces/errors.
            Traces/errors for the LMI import are not put into a category but placed in the outermost
            level, to ease the access to them.</p>
        <h1>Interactivity</h1>
        <p> Traces/errors have commonly child nodes which are the subjects of an trace/error. By
            double-clicking them, they can be opened and navigated in their (default Eclipse)
            editor.</p>
