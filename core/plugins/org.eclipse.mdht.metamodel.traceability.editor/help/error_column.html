	<h1>Error Column </h1>
	<h2>Description</h2>
        <p> 	This is a special column that aggregates any errors that are detected in correlations or mappings between the model sources. These may be LMI Import errors for SCS elements that cannot be inserted correctly into the UML CDA structure based on their re-usable mappings, or they may be failed correlations between columns that are meant to match.
        </p> 
	<h2>Key Status</h2>
	<p> Primary Key
	</p>
	<h2>Technology Space</h2>
        <p> EMF Trace metamodel instance
        </p> 
	<h2>Cardinality</h2>
        <p> 1
        </p> 
	<h2>Correlates With</h2>  
        <p> <a href="scs_data_component.html">SCS: Data Component</a> AND/OR <a href="uml_element.html"> UML: Element </a> when an element is created by LMI, but is not complete or consistent with mapping rules.
        </p> 
	<h2>Cell Navigation Links To</h2>
	<p> When no UML element was created: to the trace file, and trace instance where a SCS Data Component could not be used to create an MDHT CDA UML element because a re-usable mapping could not be found. 
        </p> 
	<p> OR when an MDHT CDA model element could be created, but is incomplete or inconsistent with the CDA mapping rules, the celss navigates to the MDHT model element in the UML Table editor.
